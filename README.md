# i3-lemonbar

Status script and configuration for [Lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) and [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/).

Configuration is taken from beautiful powerline setup by [electro7](https://github.com/electro7/dotfiles/tree/master/.i3/lemonbar).

Status feeder script is written completely in Python and uses [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python) for most of the interaction with i3.
